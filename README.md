## About

This program supplements Item randomizers such as Archipelago with enemy and dungeon randomization. This includes changing the general theme of a dungeon. For example, Thieves Town can be converted to Ice Palace theme and enemies, etc.

This mod preserves all item logic present in the game, but will switch the hazards, enemies, and sometimes the NPCs to make the game fresher for fans of Zelda 3.
