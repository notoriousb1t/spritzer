If there is demand to make this togglable, please file an issue.</li><li><strong>Dungeon Shuffle</strong> - By default, shuffling bosses also shuffles the appearance and characteristics of the dungeons. In some cases, like Tower of Hera, the boss room may change appearance. Please file an issue, if there is demand to turn this off.</li><li><strong>Visual Enemy Changes</strong> - Some enemies have changed color palettes to be more stable across different locations. For example, mini-moldorm uses the blue palette index since it is more consistent in different areas. Also moldorm has a randomized number of eyes.</li><li><strong>Overworld Simplication</strong> - Enemies/NPCs will remain the same before and after killing Agahnim unless the room has a specific item logic. i.e. Hyrule Castle, Lumberjack&#39;s house, etc.</li></ol><h2 id="how-to-patch-an-archipelago-game" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-patch-an-archipelago-game"><span>How to patch an Archipelago game</span></a></h2>',30),r={href:"http://https://archipelago.gg",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},s=(0,n.Lk)("li",null,"Download the patch file and run the alttp file.
